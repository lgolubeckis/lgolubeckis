I'm Lukas, a dedicated and analytical professional with a strong educational foundation in data visualization, analytics, and business intelligence, 
complemented by extensive experience in sales, management, and customer service. Currently, I'm in the final stages of completing the TripleTen 
Business Analytics Certification, a rigorous program that has honed my skills and deepened my expertise in the field.

About Me
I have a diverse background, blending my passions for data and performance engineering:
Automotive Enthusiast: I have many years of experience in helping people by consulting on and performing modifications for race cars and off-road vehicles, 
improving their performance for competitive events or personal enjoyment.
Retired Athlete: Growing up, I played hockey at a highly competitive level. In an effort to give back to the community and help future generations of 
hockey players, Iâ€™ve volunteered as a coach to develop young playersâ€™ athletic and social skills both on and off the ice.
Pet Lover: I'm the proud owner of two adorable cats, Holley and Sammy.
Fitness & Outdoors: I love staying active! I weight train 3-5 times a week and enjoy camping, hiking, surfing, snorkeling, and just about anything outdoors.
Foodie: Cooking a great meal is one of my favorite ways to unwind and get creative, especially with friends and family.
Location: I currently live in Las Vegas, NV, but Iâ€™m open to relocating for the right opportunity.

On top of all this, I'm eagerly working toward landing my first job as a data analyst, applying my analytical mindset and skills to help businesses make 
data-driven decisions.
